	<h1> Our General Wishlist </h1>
		<p> Imagine being uprooted from your community and having to flee for your life with just a few of your belongings. Imagine that, on top of having to navigate such hardship, you’re also menstruating. Where would you access pads, tampons, liners? It’s not exactly something that those managing refugees camps would think to prioritize when already attempting to provide clean water, food and shelter. </p>
		<p> Women make up 10 percent of the Calais refugee population. Because of their sex, they are often subject to harassment, assault and some ultimately are forced to take on a male “protector” in exchange for sex.
		Considering many of these women faced violent strife in their native countries, terrifying journeys and now adverse conditions in the camp, the comfort of a sanitary pad can bring at least some small, albeit meaningful, relief. </p>
